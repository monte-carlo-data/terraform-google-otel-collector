# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Monte Carlo values independent security research and believes responsible vulnerability disclosure ensures user security and privacy.

Please do **NOT** raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to security@montecarlodata.com.
